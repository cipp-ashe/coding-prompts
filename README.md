# Coding Prompts

A collection of high-quality prompts for AI-assisted software development. These prompts are designed to improve code quality, reduce errors, and establish robust engineering practices.

## Available Prompts

### [Verification First Implementation Protocol](./prompts/verification-first-protocol.md)

A comprehensive framework for AI pair programming that emphasizes evidence-based decision making and proper complexity calibration.

**Best for:**
- Legacy system refactoring
- High-stakes implementations where mistakes are expensive
- Projects requiring rigorous verification and proof
- Preventing hallucinations and over-engineering

**Key Features:**
- Hallucination resistance through grep-level verification
- Blast-radius control for limiting unintended changes
- Seven-step recursive execution protocol
- Distinction between essential and accidental complexity
