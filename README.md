# Coding Prompts

A curated collection of engineering protocols, methodologies, and prompts for effective software development.

## 📚 Contents

### Engineering Protocols

- **[Verification-First Engineering Protocol](prompts/verification-first-engineering.md)** - A rigorous approach to code changes that avoids both dumbing down and gold-plating. Demands grep-level evidence, controls blast radius, and systematically untangles legacy complexity.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for:
- Evidence-based engineering practices
- Code change protocols that preserve quality
- Methodologies for handling legacy systems
- Frameworks for separating essential vs accidental complexity

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each prompt in this repository is self-contained and includes:
- Core principles and philosophy
- Step-by-step protocols
- Practical examples
- Checklists for application
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## 📖 How to Use

1. Browse the `prompts/` directory for available protocols
2. Read through the protocol relevant to your current challenge
3. Apply the framework to your specific situation
4. Adapt the principles to your context while maintaining the core philosophy

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to suggest improvements or add new protocols that follow similar rigor and evidence-based approaches.
